Features allow user to:
roll the dice as player one,
roll the dice as player two,
the first player who reaches a total of 20
is displayed a winner's messages.

Features:
-ability to reset the scoreboard and player's score by clicking the reset button,
-ability to roll the dice by clicking Roll the Dice button.
-well-matched colors of the design.

My Additions:
-added pointers to indicate player's turn.
-added @keyframes animations triggered when user resets the game,
the animation swoops away the points,
-added suitable UI colors.
-added functonality to render images of dice instead of displaying plain numbers generated based on the random number function
